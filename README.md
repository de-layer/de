# De Layer Node Repository

Welcome to the official repository for the De Layer node. This repository will house the complete codebase necessary for running nodes on the De Layer subnet, a key component of the Bittensor network with EVM-compatible functionalities.

## Overview

The "de" node is engineered to support the functionalities of the De Layer subnet, ensuring reliable communication, data integrity, and consistent uptime within the network. 

## Features

- **Full Node Capabilities:** The repository will include all necessary components to set up and run a full node on the De Layer subnet, enabling complete synchronization with the network and the ability to process, mine, and validate transactions.
- **EVM Compatibility:** Designed to be fully EVM-compatible, the node can execute Ethereum-based smart contracts, interact with the blockchain, and support the deployment of decentralized applications.
- **Network Security:** The node will contribute to the security and robustness of the De Layer network, participating in consensus mechanisms and helping to prevent potential attacks or network disruptions.
- **Up-to-Date Synchronization:** The node software will be configured to automatically stay updated with the latest network rules and protocols, ensuring seamless operation and compatibility with ongoing network upgrades.

## Contributing

We will welcome contributions from the community to improve the node's functionality, security, and efficiency. We appreciate enhancements, bug fixes, documentation improvements, and other changes that help in advancing the De Layer node.
